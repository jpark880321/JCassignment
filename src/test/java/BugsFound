--Bugs found in Password Hashing Application--

1. POST /hash endpoint does not immediately return a job identifier
Expected Result: It takes about 5000 ms for a job identifier to be returned

1. POST /hash endpoint allows keys other than "password"
Expected Result: No other keys other than "password" should be allowed when submitting this request

2. POST /hash endpoint allows empty password value input
Expected Result: The "password" key should always require a value for submission

3. POST /hash endpoint allows empty json as its input
Expected Result: Similar to #2, empty json should be be allowed as a parameter

4. Base64 encoded password hash does not match the expected value
Expected Result: Assuming only the value of the key is used for hashing, the expected encoded hash for "angrymonkey" is "MzRkZDBmMDBhYjYyNzlhY2EyNGQ4ZjNmNDFkZTc3MDFlMzMzMWU0NmVmNjQzNzcwNjE4ODgzOWYwYjQzNzZmZmM1MjE2YmRjY2I1YjBhMDliZWVhOGJiMzZlZjEwZjAyNzdmMzJhOGQwN2IyMDg4ZDI5NThhMGM2YTdiZTAwZDY=" which does not equal to the actual encoded has value of "NN0PAKtieayiTY8/Qd53AeMzHkbvZDdwYYiDnwtDdv/FIWvcy1sKCb7qi7Nu8Q8Cd/MqjQeyCI0pWKDGp74A1g==".

5. GET /stats endpoint allows keys
Expected Result: This endpoint should not accept any key parameter

6. /stats endpoint accepts non-GET (POST) operation
Expected Result: This endpoint should only accept GET calls

7. Average Time calculated does not match the expected
Expected Result: Based on the testGetStats automated test, the expected average time for two POST /hash requests is estimated to be around 5000 ms but the actual was well over 100000 ms.

8. Multi POST /hash requests do not process simultaneously (asynchronously)
Expected Result: Each request seem to process synchronously with each request taking around 5000 ms (i.e. if there are 3 requests submitted total, all three requests should process simultaneously with each returning a corresponding job identifier).
